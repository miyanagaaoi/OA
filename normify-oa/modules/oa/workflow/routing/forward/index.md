      Group-level chained routing: approvers at the finance node and later may designate the next receiving department and keep the document inside the group layer, supporting continuous chains A-B-C; a receiving department and a reason are mandatory and the department must be able to see the document. Routing writes flow_routing and advances the routing sequence and current department.
